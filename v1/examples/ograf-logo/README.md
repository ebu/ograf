# Reference: Minimal Graphic

This is a version of minimal implementation of a Graphic.
It fades IN and OUT a image-file.
It contains the minimum required properties and methods to be a valid Graphic.

_Note: This is intended to be used when developing and validating renderer systems._
_If you're looking for a good starting point for developing Graphics, use the [L3rd Name example](../l3rd-name/) instead._
