# EBU OGraf

**EBU OGraf** is a specification for Web-based Broadcast Graphics.
It allows for inter-operability between Graphics-providers (developers), Controllers and Renderers.


There are two parts to the OGraf specification, targeting different use cases:

* The **OGraf Graphics specification** defines how a _graphic_ should work. An OGraf Graphic is a web-component.

* The **OGraf Server API** specifies a RESTful API to be used between a _Controller_ (such as a graphics control client, or automation system) and an _OGraf Renderer_.
